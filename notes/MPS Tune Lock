[[Category:Implementation Note]]

==Introduction and Scope==
The minimum Root Mean Square (RMS) beam size achievable onto the
EHDT dump is around 0.3mm1. With such a beam size it is safe to send
up to 1.0kW onto the EHDT dump.Above 1.0kW, it is essential to maintain the beam spot above
a 2 RMS beam radius of 6 mm.To control the beam size it was initially
considered to enforce the setting of the last two EHDT quadrupoles: unfortunately
this measure is insufficient as the final spot size is determined
by the setting of all the upstream optical elements. In this document we
propose to overcome this difficulty by implementing a modification of the existing
Machine Protection System (MPS) Beam Modes (implemented in
the EPICS control system). The proposed modification of the MPS will affect
all Beam Modes.
The application scope of the tune lock is in fact not restricted to the EHDT
dump. Although the initial motivation comes from EHDT, the approach is
necessary and valid for the beam parameters in EHBT at the AETE target
station.

==Definitions==
* ‘Low-power beam modes’ are: NO BEAM, SCINTILLATE, and OTRVIEWER.
* All other beam modes are referred to as ‘high-power beam modes’.
* ‘Optical elements’ are: solenoids and quadrupoles.
* ‘Magnetic elements’ are: optical elements, benders and correction benders.
* ‘RF parameters’ are: the amplitude and phase set points of ELBT:BUNCH, EINJ, and EACA.

==Requirements==
RS-1: Low-power beam modes shall allow for average currents no greater
than 2 μA. The beam shall be tripped if the average current exceeds
2 μA.
Rationale: The risk is not only related to the average beam power.
At low duty cycle a single pulse can carry enough energy to create
damage.
Comment: The pulse charge can be monitored using an AC or a DC
current transformer.
Comment: Note that 2 μA at 30MeV corresponds to 60W.

RS-2: When a low-power beam mode is granted no constraint is applied to
the set point of magnetic elements.
Rationale: Low-power beam modes are used to determine beam energy,
and setup a suitable steering and optics tune.
Comment: In a low-power beam mode it is safe to lose all the beam.

RS-3: When a high-power beam mode is requested, the set point of all the
optics elements and benders upstream of the beam terminus shall be
locked prior to granting the beam request.
Rationale: This way the beam size onto the beam terminus cannot be
changed by operators.
Comment: The set point of correction benders is not locked: it is the
role of the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) part of the MPS to look after
beam steering.
Comment: Locking does not guarantee the correctness of the tune.
For this purpose we rely on tuning procedures, and on the machine
protection system (beam loss and beam position).
Comment: It is the responsibility of the operator to request a highpower
beam mode after having verified using a low-power tune that
the beam size onto the beam terminus is large enough.

RS-4: The Control System shall trip the beam if any of the locked power supplies:
# lose communication, or
# see their readback drift by more than +/-0.5% of the full range (DRVH-DRVL).
Rationale: To turn off the beam if the locked tune is lost.

RS-5: Once a high-power beam mode has been granted, the set point of the
RF parameters are to be maintained within a window: +/- 5 deg. for RF
phases and +/-1% of the full range for RF amplitudes.
Rationale: RF parameters tend to drift over long periods of time, and
often need online re-adjustments.
Comment: Since RF is controlled indirectly through the e-Linac Control
System, by passing messages to the LLRF control system, this requirement
prescribes a window of eligible setpoints available through
the control system for use by operators.
