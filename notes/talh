===Set up the alarm limit===
The alarm limits are configured by the user in the HIHI, LOLO, HIGH, and LOW fields using numerical values. For each of these fields, there is a corresponding severity field which can be either NO_ALARM, MINOR, or MAJOR. The corresponding severity fields are: HHSV, LLSV, HSV, and LSV.
# Find which IOC hosts those PVs
# Find if there is an existing alarm configuration ioc script for that IOC - they can be found under /usr1/xxx/iocscr directory. The name starts with alarmcfg (example: alarmcfgplc1.iocscr)
# Edit existing file or create a new file - add required lines. Review before committing the change.
## One line to set the alarm limit
## One line to set the severity
# CVS and put the file over to the production (Make sure you have a work permit)
# IOC boot configure and reload the file. For this change, you don't need to reboot the IOC.
# Can confirm the change by doing a caget on the PV field
===Set up the alarm handler configuration file===
# Which alarm configuration file be modified? Check with Ops to verify. You could try to find similar records in the current alarm handler configuration file as well.
# Edit the suggested alarm configuration file - you can get the idea by looking at what is implement for other records. I would like to review before committing the change.
# CVS and copy the file over to the production server. With TAlh, to allow the Ops to edit the configuration file, we have moved the configuration files to /data/isacdata/talh_config directory. "put" command is not setup to copy the file to that directory, and we don't allow "write" on the sunbeam data directory mount point on the development server, so we have to scp the file over.
# Ask the RIB Ops to restart the alarm handler
# Verify alarms are set up.
